Google’s new messaging app to have artificial intelligence

Google is going to give a twist to normal messaging apps by coming up with a new one that employs artificial intelligence. The technology will bring Google’s data smarts to a chat bot service in the software.

The new chat service will be an interesting feature allowing users to talk with friends or ask question of the chat bot. In return, the chat bot will look for answers from the search engine giant’s vast map of the internet.
