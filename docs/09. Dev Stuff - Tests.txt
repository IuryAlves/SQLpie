== Running code tests

    * A lot of tests have been created for SQLpie.
    * They try to test lots of different API scenarios.
    * More tests will be added in the future.
    
    Before running the tests, you need to ensure you have a test database in place.
    Tests are allways executed in the test environment as the database is also reset at the beginning of each test.
    
    To create the test database, execute the command below.
    
    $ sqlpie_env=test python scripts/create_db.py
    
    Next, to run the tests, type:
    
    $ python ./scripts/run_tests.py

    If you need to run the tests in debug mode so you can get more detailed information about the code execution, type:
    
    $ sqlpie_debug=true python scripts/run_tests.py


== About the run_tests.py test script

    * The script imports all classes in the /tests directory.
    * It resets the entire tests database.
    * And it runs all the tests.

    Every major component of the system has its own set of tests.
    They're all imported and tested by the run_tests.py script.
