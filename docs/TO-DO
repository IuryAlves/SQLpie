                            Some SQLpie TO DO ideas


See README and/or http://sqlpie.com for more information.

These are just some of the ideas for the framework, in no specific priority order.

================================ Unknown Release ==============================

* Treat document buckets just like any other field;
    - That involves removing the Bucket table and using the special field "_bucket" just like any other field.
    - This improvement might also help searching across buckets.
    - All queries that link tables by bucket_id will also benefit as the extra join would go away.

* Test the framework for scalability using lots of documents and observationa;
    - Explain Framework Limitations;
    - Review the Database Schema
    - Create any necessary table indexes	

* Create an easy way to integrate it with 3rd-party APIs (Bing, LinkedIn, SimplyHired, Google Maps, etc...);

* Create an embedded Data Visualization feature;

* Improve Search Performance;

* Support Query Synonyms (e.g. US, USA, U.S.A, U.S., United States, etc...);

* Support nGram Search Indices;

* Support Phonetic Search;

* Add "Sentiment Analysis and Spam/Ham" examples involving the Classification Service;

* Create a demo using a large dataset;

* Create a Numeric Prediction Service (that is based on Linear Regression);
    - Currently, we can do Label Prediction (using the Classifier Service)

* Cleanup excessive whitespaces in SQL statements;
