== Developing code for SQLpie

    First, some key realities:

    * SQLpie is not complete or perfect.
    * SQLpie is intended to be built upon and further extended. 
	* SQLpie had a purpose when first created. Hopefully, it's still useful.
	* Not all SQLpie services are likely to perform well with very large datasets - some testing is required.
    
    To Be Documented: Add details about the overall architecture.
